# Add Yanko to Pocket

I love [Yanko Design](http://www.yankodesign.com/) so much that I literally want to read all of the blog.

## Task
Export all of Yanko Design's blog posts to bookmarks files, and import those into Pocket.

## Learning Outcomes
- BeautifulSoup
- Bookmarks files

## Code Considerations
- This added over 16,000 articles to my reading list. Do you want the same for your reading list?
