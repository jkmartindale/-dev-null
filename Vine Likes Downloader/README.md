# Vine Likes Downloader

In the beginning of 2017, Vine shut down the last remaining part of their service.

##Task
Download [@resir014](https://resir014.github.io/)'s likes before Vine shuts down.

##Learning Outcomes
- Consuming paginated REST data
- PHP HTTP GET requests without cURL
- Downloading binary data

##Code Considerations
- The script is hardcoded to work with either [@resir014](https://resir014.github.io/)'s or my profile, and thus must be changed
- Don't even try, as it appears Vine's API has shut down
