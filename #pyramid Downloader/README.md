# #pyramid Downloader

#pyramid on Freenode uses BotBot.me for logging, which was cool until BotBot.me disabled log searching

## Task
Download all the logs, with one file per day, preferably starting off from wherever downloads left off last time.

## Learning Outcomes
- BeautifulSoup basics
- Python's `datetime` module
- Python's `glob` module
- Working with files in Python

## Code Considerations
- Assumes that a `#pyramid` folder exists and might not work without one
-  I forgot to make this script work without already existing log files
