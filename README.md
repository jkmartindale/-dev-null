# Junk Drawer

A digital graveyard for projects that are not of any interest as a whole. Code created for extremely niche uses, cancelled projects, and other incomplete and unmaintained things. These projects are retained in the slim chance some snippet of them could prove useful in the future. No need to crudely reconstruct the wheel more than once, right?

I have a habit of sketching out a fleeting idea, and then deleting what I write because it is gross and bad. This repository is a catch-all for that junk, in hopes that in the future I will clean it up and move it out.
