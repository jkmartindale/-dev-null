# /dev/null
A digital graveyard for projects that are not of any interest as a whole. Code created for extremely niche uses, cancelled projects, and other incomplete and unmaintained things. These projects are retained in the slim chance some snippet of them could prove useful in the future. No need to crudely reconstruct the wheel more than once, right?

Each project has a description of the task, learning outcomes (which give hints to what part of the code may be useful), and considerations in case you're drunk and somehow want to run the code.

**Batch to Java:** Java: writing files, executing Windows commands<br>
**Palette Rotation:** PHP: editing binary data, string replacement with arrays, and DirectoryIterator; BMP file format<br>
**Vine Likes Downloader:** PHP: consuming paginated REST data, HTTP GET requests without cURL, downloading binary data
